## This repo is configured to fire pre-commit hooks through husky
When npm i is installed and the prepare stage happens it installs husky.
Husky will configure the pre-commit hook which runs lint-staged.
When lint-staged fires it runs prettier to automagically format the code,
and then it checks for rule violations with eslint.
If the code is not up to the airbnb standards the commit will be denied.

The configuration for this was inspired by [this](https://github.com/pappijx/Vite-react-eslint-prettier-husky-setup/blob/master/readme.md) post.
